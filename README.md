In many Asian countries like India, Thailand or Indonesia, Garuda is the mythological messenger of the Gods. He takes the form of a great bird and brings divine messages to mankind.

Accordingly, this plugin allows sending of Stud.IP messages to selectable target audiences by using the UserFilter mechanism introduced in Stud.IP 3.0.
